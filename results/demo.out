This code illustrates parameter passing strategy.

before function work:
value of x is:
0
value of f is:
5
--------------------------------
the call to function work may be seen as
work( f, x );
and function work may be seen as
work( INOUT int ff, INOUT int xx )
---------------------------------
after function work:
value of x is:
1
value of f is:
6
